# AI Voice Chatbot Tutorial

This is a simple chat application built using Flask & React. It allows users to send messages to a chatbot, then get an AI driven response and hear it with audio (while text gets highlighted). The chat interface displays messages in a conversation-style format.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have python and flask.

# BackEnd

python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
python3 app.py

Runs the server on port 5000

# FrontEnd

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
